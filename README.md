Crash Risk Prediction and Analysis:

The Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP) leverages open data to create data-driven insights aimed at improving road safety. Through this project, participants use data science techniques such as data cleaning, geospatial analysis, and time-series analysis to assess road conditions, contributing factors, and more. By engaging in real-world datasets, learners are equipped to build analytical models for safer transportation. The project fosters collaboration and learning, offering different tracks for learners based on their experience, with the opportunity to present findings to mentors from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
This project aims to predict high-risk crash locations and analyze contributing factors using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical crash data and various features such as geographic location, crash severity, and contributing factors, the goal is to create a predictive model that can forecast future crashes. We use the XGBoost algorithm to train the model, and visualize the results using interactive maps and heatmaps to highlight high-risk zones. This approach can be used to improve traffic safety by identifying areas that require intervention.
